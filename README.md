# Research and Projects

This repository will hold smaller projects and research papers that I have completed or participated in.
A lot of this may be incomplete. For better documentation click the links that are in the ReadME files in each folder.
Many of these folders will only include a paper(s) and a ReadME file with information about the
completion and purpose of the research/project.
For more information. Please contact me.
